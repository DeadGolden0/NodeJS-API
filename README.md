## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeadGolden0/NodeJS-API.git
cd NodeJS-API
npm install
```

## üìã Configuration
Setup and configure the **NodeJS Environement (ENV)**.

> [!TIP]
> You can run the all command with `sudo` if it requires access to restricted files or elevated privileges. Just prepend `sudo` to the command.

Next, you need to configure **NGINX/Apache Server** for **Reverse Proxy**

nano exemple.com
```

Add new location to your configuration file
```bash
location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:YourSelectedPort;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
